#   Ultimately the best would be to have a jupyter notebook to launch instances of the evo algo
#   and several files having all the functions I would need and that I could replace as I wish
#   And at first simply having a main python file that I could toy with until I'm sure my functions are written right
#   Or maybe it's not how it's meant to be
#
#   Ou ptet que ce que je dis c'est de la merde et faut pas faire Ã§a lol
